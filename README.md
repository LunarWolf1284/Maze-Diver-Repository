# Maze-Diver-Repository

This project is supposed to be a maze-diver web-game. It includes exploration, loot, and monsters.

# Coding tips
- Keep files somewhat like how this is organized
- Try to keep files local to the repository; try not to link to other files outside the project
- Prioritize code that is readable/understandable over what is efficient (given only minor impacts on runtime)
- ADD COMMENTS
